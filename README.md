# Mapping_Earthquakes
`Using JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey.`
## Resources
- Javascript
- Leaflet
- HTML
- CSS
- Mapbox API

## Overview of Project

In this repository, I have utilizing the Leaflet library of JavaScript as well as an API to populate a geographical map through the use of GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Every earthquake is represented on these maps in a circle. Those with a higher magnitude possess a darker color as well as a larger diamater. In addition to this, each earthquake includes a popup marker that showcases both its magnitude and its location. I have created a geographical map with two maps and an overlay, but this challenge asks me to create a map that includes earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates' location on the earth. Additionally, I am asked to populate my map with all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. Lastly, all the data will be showcased on a dark third map.

## Results

This weeks module consists of the following three deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

This is a geographical map depicting tectonic plate data in addition to earthquake data.

### Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

This picture includes all of the data for earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.

### Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

The picture above depicts an alternative style as shown through a dark view.

## Summary

In conclusion, I have created three maps. The first adds tectonic plate data to my previous map through the overlay object with my earthquake data as seen through circles for every instance. The second is a filter of sorts that shows more powerful earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. And the third shows a third style to my map through my use of JavaScript and Leaflet.js.
